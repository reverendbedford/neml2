/**
 * @brief This class spits out the creep strain rate along with the rate of two other internal
 * variables, given the von Mises stress, temperature, and the current internal state as input.
 *
 * This is notionally the example for the so-called LAROMANCE type of reduced order models. For
 * demonstration purposes, the rate equations are just 2nd order polynomials of the form
 *
 * \[
 * \dot{y}_k = \tilde{\delta}_{ij} \left( A^0_{ijk} + A^1_{ijkl} x_l + A^2_{ijkl} x_l^2 \right)
 * \]
 *
 * where $x_k$ is the model input, and $\dot{y}_k$ is the model output. $A^0_{ij}$, $A^1_{ij}$, and
 * $A^2_{ij}$ are coefficient matrices. $\tilde{\delta}_{ij}$ is the regularized Kronecker delta
 * function for selecting the input domain.

   * A0 is of shape (...; 2, 3, 3)
   * A1 and A2 are of shape (...; 2, 3, 3, 4)
   * It is vital to understand why they have these particular shapes!
   *
   * For A1 and A2:
   *
   * The last two base dimensions are 3-by-4, because we have 4 input variables: von Mises stress,
   * temperature, and two internal variables, and 3 output variables: equivalent creep strain rate
   * and rates of the two internal variables.
   *
   * The first two base dimensions are 2-by-3. They are essentially the size of the table used to
   * choose the function domain. In this example, I use von Mises stress and temperature as the two
   * axes of the table. The von Mises stress is tiled into 2 intervals, and the temperature is tiled
   * into 3 intervals. Hence the shape 2-by-3.
   *
   * Same reasoning applies to the constant coefficient matrix A0.
